## Description

Complete the snacks below by placing each snack in its folder inside the repo. In each snack folder, you will put the necessary html/js files.

#### Snack 1

1. Create an array of 10 cars.
   (Each car object will have the following properties: `make`, `model`, and `power supply` (gasoline, diesel, LPG, electric, methane).)
2. Divide cars into 3 separate arrays: in the first array only petrol cars, in the second only diesel cars, in the third the rest of cars.
3. Finally, print the 3 arrays separately.

#### Snack 2

- From an array of strings, create a second array by formatting the strings of the first array in lowercase and with a capital initial.
- Example: `['foo', 'PLUTO', 'Donald']` => `['Goofy', 'Pluto', 'Donald']`

#### Snack 3

1. Create an array of objects representing animals.

   - Each animal has a `name`, a `family`, and a `class`.
     Example:

   ```javascript
   [
     { name: "lion", family: "felidi", class: "mammals" },
     { name: "dog", family: "canids", class: "mammals" },
     { name: "hen", family: "phasianids", class: "birds" },
   ];
   ```

## Tools

# _SNACK 5_

1. Create a racing bike array:

- each bicivar√† the following properties: `name` and `weight`.

2. Console printing of the lowest weight bike using destructuring and literal template

# _SNACK 6_

1. Create an array of football team objects.

- Each team will have different properties: `name`, `points made`, `fouls suffered`.

2. `Name` will be the only property to be compiled, the others will all be set to 0.

3. Generating random numbers instead of 0 in properties: `points made` and `fouls suffered`.

4. Finally, using deconstruction, create a new array whose elements contain only names and faults suffered and print everything in the console.

### Snack 1

- Create an array of 10 cars
  (Each car object will have the following properties: `make`, `model`, and `power supply`)
- Divide cars into 3 separate arrays: in the first array only petrol cars, in the second only diesel cars, in the third the rest of cars.
- Separate cars based on fuel type = iteration between different types of `car.filter`

### Snack 2

- Add an array
- `map` function to create a new array
- Uppercase to lowercase letters method
